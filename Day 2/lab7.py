#you live 4 miles from university.
#the bus drives at 25 mph but spends 2 minutes at each of the 10 stops on the way. how long will the bus journey take?
#Alternatively, you could run to university. you jog the first mile at 7mph: then run the next two at 15mph; 
#before jogging the last at 7mph again. will this be quicker or slowerthan the bus?

distance=4
velocity=25
time1=(distance/velocity)+60

#the bus spend two minutes in each ten steps so 2+10
